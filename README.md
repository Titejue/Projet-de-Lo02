# Crazy Eights - LO02 Project

This project is realized within the LO02's teaching framework ( *Principle and practice of the objects oriented programming* ).
We want to design with UML and develop in Java a version of the "Crazy Eights" card game.

## What is the Crazy Eights ?

The name Crazy Eights dates to the 1940s, derived from the United States military designation for discharge of mentally unstable soldiers, Section 8. It could have been imported to France by US soldiers after the 1944 landing.
In France, the game is now called American eight. 

The object of the game is to be the first to get rid of all the player's cards to a discard pile.
There are many variations of the basic game like **UNO**.
We will follow the rules proposed by the website Wikipedia to develop our game :
